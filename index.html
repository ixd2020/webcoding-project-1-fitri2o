      Who is Paul Rand?
    </h2>
    <p class="story">
      Born Peretz Rosenbaum in 1914 and deceased in 1996, Paul Rand is a graphic
      design legend. Throughout his 60-years long career, he changed America's
      opinion on visual communication. With his editorial designs,
      advertisements, and visual identity works, Rand brought avant-garde
      European ideas to the United-States, mixing visual arts and commercial
      design. His colourful combinations, approach of typography and use of
      media translate his desire to "defamiliarize the ordinary". His style
      consequently still have an impact on graphic design today.
